### Description

This example is to show how to shuffle a deck of cards using an extremely fast algorithm that does not have to check if a card has already been chosen. What this means is that the code is very fast making it very scalable as well. Although the example uses a deck of cards, it could just as easily be used to shuffle any series of objects with thousands of items.
